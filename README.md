# Analyzing the Demand-Supply Gap in the Dublin Airbnb Market

# Introduction:
The Airbnb market in Dublin has seen substantial growth in recent years. However, with this growth comes the challenge of balancing guest demand with the availability of listings. This project aims to identify, analyze, and provide insights into the demand-supply dynamics within Dublin's Airbnb market.

# Objective:
To evaluate the existing demand-supply gap in the Airbnb market in Dublin and offer data-driven recommendations for optimizing the number and quality of listings to better align with guest demand.

# Data Description:
The analysis will utilize two primary datasets:

Searches Dataset: Contains records of user search behavior, including search dates, check-in/check-out dates, number of guests, and other filters used during the search.
Contacts Dataset: Includes details of communications and transactions between guests and hosts, such as inquiry times, reply times, acceptance, and booking timestamps.

# Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the datasets to ensure quality and consistency in the analysis.

Demand Analysis: Analyze the searches dataset to understand what guests are searching for, including preferred dates, stay duration, and room types.

Supply Analysis: Evaluate the contacts dataset to assess host response behavior and listing availability.

Gap Analysis: Compare demand indicators with supply metrics to identify any mismatches or gaps in the market.

Predictive Modeling: Utilize time series analysis and forecasting models to predict future demand trends and identify periods of potential undersupply.

Market Simulation: Develop simulations to explore how adjustments in the number of listings, pricing strategies, or host incentives may affect the market balance.

# Expected Outcomes:

A detailed report on demand patterns and their correlation with supply availability.
Identification of periods and conditions where the demand-supply gap is most significant.
Predictive insights into future demand trends and their implications for market balance.
Strategic recommendations for Airbnb and its hosts in Dublin to enhance market efficiency and improve booking rates.
Conclusion:
The project will culminate in strategic action points for Airbnb to consider, aimed at bridging the demand-supply gap and enhancing the overall health of the Dublin Airbnb ecosystem
